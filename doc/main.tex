\maketitle

\abstract{This report gives a time series analysis of historical Walmart sales data about more than three thousand different products sold across three different states in the United States. The data is part of the M5 forecasting competition \citep{Makridakis2020} and in addition to the time series analysis we also propose and describe a forecasting system and analyze its prediction capabilities.}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Definition}
TODO: add the problem definition here.

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The dataset is given by the \emph{M5 competition} available on Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy}.} which is the current installment in the popular M competition series on forecasting \citep{Makridakis2020}. The dataset includes time series data of the sales of various Walmart store products divided hierarchically by the item level, department, product category, and geographical area. The dataset also includes explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events (e.g. Valentine's Day, Orthodox Easter, and the Super Bowl, one of the largest sporting events in American Football). There are $3,075$ products classified in $3$ product categories and $7$ product departments. The products are sold across $10$ stores in $3$ different states (California, Texas, and Wisconsin). The total number of M5 series across the entire hierarchy is $42,840$.  More information on the data can be found \href{https://mk0mcompetitiont8ake.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/M5-Competitors-Guide_Final-1.pdf}{on the M5 competition website} or on Kaggle.


\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
The data consists of 3 files: \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{calender.csv}: containing the columns: \texttt{date}: the date in Year-Month-Day format, \texttt{wm\_yr\_wk}: code the week year from the dataset starting date, \texttt{weekday}: the weekday, \texttt{wday}: the weekday's number, starting from Saturday, \texttt{month}: the month, \texttt{year}: the year, \texttt{d}: the incremental ID of the day in the dataset, \texttt{event\_name\_1}: name of the event occurring in this day, if one exists, \texttt{event\_type\_1}: type of the event occurring in this day, if one exists, \texttt{event\_name\_2}: name of the second event occurring in that date,if one exists, \texttt{event\_type\_2}: type of the second event occurring in that date, if one exists, \texttt{snap\_CA}, \texttt{snap\_TX}, \texttt{snap\_WI}: 1 if SNAP\footnote{The Supplement Nutrition 
    Assistance Program (SNAP) provides low income families and individuals with an Electronic Benefits Transfer 
    debit card to purchase food products, this purchasing process is done monthly across 10 days} purchases are allowed on this date.
    \item \texttt{sales\_train\_validation.csv}: containing the columns: \texttt{id}, with the id of the item codes as \textit{item\_id}\_\textit{store\_id}\_validation, \texttt{item\_id}: product ID, \texttt{dept\_id}: department ID,
    \texttt{cat\_id}: category ID, \texttt{store\_id}: store ID, \texttt{state\_id}: state ID. and extra 1913 columns containing the total sold items each day from \texttt{d\_1} to \texttt{d\_1913}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Calender-Focused Analysis}
The data starts at \date{January 29, 2011} to \date{June 19, 2016}, with day-count up to 1969. The dataset contains 30 events, some of them are repeated (counting duplicates, there are 167 events). They are divided into: Cultural, National, Religious and Sporting. With Religious events being the most frequent with 55 occurrence. Checking the calender data, no missing values were found.
\subsection{Sales-Focused Analysis}
Checking the calender data, no missing values were found. But the sales data is for 1913 days only,unlike the calender. The data contains 30490 rows and 1919 columns. The data contains 3 states; California (CA), Texas (TX) and Wisconsin (WI), with 4, 3, and 3 stores respectively. It also contains 4 categories; Hobbies, Household, Foods, with 2, 2, and 3 departments respectively.

    Here, it is clear that CA has the more products, this could just be a result of it having more stores.

        \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{{"Share of each store from the products"}}
    \end{figure}
    Investigating further, we find that this is just the case. Meaning that Walmart equalizes between these markets.

        Walmart stocks up on products of department FOODS\_3 the most.

        \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{{"Total Sales per Store for Each Department"}}
    \end{figure}
    The following 4 figures the total sales plot aren't the most informative, due to large variation between different departments, so they were normalized and stacked for better visualization:

Draft of the analysis points we should cover, divided into 2 parts: doing, and haven't started, since the done ones can be seen above. Will be updated with more points, if we think of more, and the current state of each one. This is just a draft to do list and will surely be replaced in the final document.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Haven't started: \begin{enumerate}
        \item total revenue in each store
        \item total revenue in each state
        \item total revenue of each category
        \item total revenue of each category given the state
        \item total revenue of each category given the store
        \item total revenue of each category given an event happens in that day
        \item total revenue in each weekday
        \item total revenue in each month
        \item total revenue in each year
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Doing:  \begin{enumerate}
        \item total sold items of each category given an event happens in that day
       \item total sold items of each department given an event happens in that day
        \item total sold items in each weekday
        \item total sold items in each month
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Forecasting}


\bibliography{main}

\section{Proposal}
\ahmed{Will probably remove this later.}
\subsection{Idea}
We want to forecast the unit sales of different products sold by Walmart markets in the United States. More precisely, given hierarchical sales data from Walmart we will forecast daily sales for two subsequent 28-day time periods.

\subsection{Planned Approach}
We aim to use a mix of statistical features specific to time series data combined with neural networks. For deseasonalization we can use techniques like exponential smoothing or other statistical procedures on sliding windows. We hope to understand the seasonality patterns in the data first and then use a recurrent neural network to predict the trends.
